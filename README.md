# BrScienceSDID
This study aims to evaluate how the change in government investment policy in science and technology impact the scientific production. All the publications of the Web of Science from 2000 to 2022 were aggregated by country/region and the effect of different policies – one expansionist and the other retractionist – were analyzed through the Synthetic Control Method. The results confirm a positive effect of the raise in investments and a marginal reduction of the publications during the retractionist period. The study also indicates that the effect of the investments has a delayed impact of approximately two years. This paper can be useful to provide a guideline for the mechanisms of public support to research and subside the decisions of policy makers based on evidence.

NOTES OF LAST UPDATE:
- The Draft of the article was updated, eventhough incomplete;
- Regarding the SDID method, all the calculations conducted on Stata considered only data from Incites until 2021; in January of 2023 this analysis will be expanded to the other databases and the year of 2022 will be included for all databases;
- Also, for the submission I hope to be able to calculate everything in Python;
- The cheatsheet upload is considering the code to be used after the inclusion of the other databases, for this intial screen I used the regular names from the original source (Incites).
